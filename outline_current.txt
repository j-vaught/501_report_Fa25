ISSUES:
-------
- Section 3 is overloaded (280 lines) - mixes implementation + theory
- FFT solver appears twice (Sec 2.4 and 3.2)
- Finite difference math is buried in "Implementation"
- Results section starts with subsubsection without subsection parent
- Boundary condition theory is in "Implementation" not math section
